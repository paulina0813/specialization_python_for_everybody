'''
FOR LOOPS
- for loops go through all the things in the set
- Definite loops (for loops) have explicit iteration variables that change each time through a loop. These iteration variables move through the sequence or set
'''
#for loop with numbers
for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
    print(i)
print("Blastoff!")

#for loops with strings
friends = ["Joseph", "Glenn", "Sally"]
for friend in friends:
    print("Happy New Year:", friend)
print("Done!")

'''
LOOKING AT IN...
- The iteration variable "iterates" through the sequence (ordered set)
- The block (body) of code is executed once for each value in the sequence
- The iteration variable moves through all of the values in the sequence
