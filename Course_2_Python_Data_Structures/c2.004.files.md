# File Processing

- A text file can be thought of as a sequence of files

# Opening a File

- Before we can read the contents of the file, we must tell Python which file we are going to work with and what we will be doing with the file
- This is done with the open() function
- open() returns a "file handle: - a variable used to perform operations on the file
- Similar to "File -> Open" in a Word Processor

# Using open()

- handle = open(filename, mode) | fhand = open('mbox.txt', 'r)
- returns a handle use to manipulate the file
- filename is a string
- mode is optional and should be 'r' if we are planning to read the file and 'w' if we are going to write to the file

# What is a handle?

- fhand = open('mbox.txt')
- print(fhand)
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='mbox.txt' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>

# When Files are missing

- If the fike doesn't exist, you get a traceback

# The Newline Character

- We use a special character called the "newline" to indicate when a line ends
- We represent it as \n in strings
- Newline is still one character - not two

# File processing

- A text file has newlines at the end of each line

# File Handle as a Sequence

- A file handle open for read can be treated as a sequence of strings where each line in the file is a string in the sequence
- We can use the for statement to iterate through a sequence
- Remember - a sequence is an ordered set

xfile = open('mbox.txt')
for cheese in xfile: #Runs the amount of times that matches the amount of lines. If there are 10 lines, it runs 10 times
    print(cheese)


# Counting Lines in a File

- Open a file read-only
- Use a for loop to read each line
- Count the lines and print out the number of lines

fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count += 1
print('Line Count:', count)

Line Count: 1389

# Reading the *Whole* File

- We can read the whole file (newlines and all) into a single string
- If you print it out, it will give you all the newlines because the print will show the newlines

fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
inp = fhand.read() #Takes whatever is in that file and sticks it into the variable
print(len(inp))
94626
print(inp[:20])

# Search Through a file

- We can put an if statement in our for loop to only print lines that meet some criteria

fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('From: '):
        print(line)

When you print this, there are a lot of blank lines. What are all these blank lines doing here?

- Each line from the file has a newline at the end
- The print statement adds a newline to each line

## Searching Through a File (fixed)

- We can strip the whitespace from the right-hand side of the string using rstrip() from the string library.
- The newline is considered "white space" and its stripped

fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if line.startswith('From: ):
        print(line)

## Skipping with Continue

- We can conviniently skip a line by ysing the continue statement
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not line.startswith('From: ):
        continue 
        #if the line doesn't start with 'From: ', then it sends it to the top of the loop without printing the line
    print(line)

## Using in to Select lines

- We can look for a string anywhere in a line as our selection criteria
fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
for line in fhand:
    line = line.rstrip()
    if not '@uct.ac.za' in line:
        continue 
        #if the line doesn't contain '@uct.ac.za', then it sends it to the top of the loop without printing the line
    print(line)

# Prompt for File name

fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
fhand = open(fname)
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count =+ 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lnes in, fname)

## Dealing with bad File Names

fname = input('Enter the file name: ')
try:
    fhand = open(fname)
except:
    print('File name cannot be opened: ', fname)
    quit()
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    if line.startswith('Subject:'):
        count =+ 1
print('There were', count, 'subject lnes in, fname)
