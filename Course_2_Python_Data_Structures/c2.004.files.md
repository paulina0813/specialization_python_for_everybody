# File Processing
- A text file can be thought of as a sequence of files

# Opening a File
- Before we can read the contents of the file, we must tell Python which file we are going to work with and what we will be doing with the file
- This is done with the open() function
- open() returns a "file handle: - a variable used to perform operations on the file
- Similar to "File -> Open" in a Word Processor

# Using open()
- handle = open(filename, mode) | fhand = open('mbox.txt', 'r)
- returns a handle use to manipulate the file
- filename is a string
- mode is optional and should be 'r' if we are planning to read the file and 'w' if we are going to write to the file

# What is a handle?
- fhand = open('mbox.txt')
- print(fhand)
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='mbox.txt' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>

# When Files are missing
- If the fike doesn't exist, you get a traceback

# The Newline Character
- We use a special character called the "newline" to indicate when a line ends
- We represent it as \n in strings
- Newline is still one character - not two

# File processing
- A text file has newlines at the end of each line

# File Handle as a Sequence
- A file handle open for read can be treated as a sequence of strings where each line in the file is a string in the sequence
- We can use the for statement to iterate through a sequence
- Remember - a sequence is an ordered set

xfile = open('mbox.txt')
for cheese in xfile: #Runs the amount of times that matches the amount of lines. If there are 10 lines, it runs 10 times
    print(cheese)


# Counting Lines in a File
- Open a file read-only
- Use a for loop to read each line
- Count the lines and print out the number of lines

fhand = open('mbox.txt')
count = 0
for line in fhand:
    count += 1
print('Line Count:', count)

Line Count: 1389

# Reading the *Whole* File
- We can read the whole file (newlines and all) into a single string
- If you print it out, it will give you all the newlines because the print will show the newlines

fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')
inp = fhand.read() #Takes whatever is in that file and sticks it into the variable
print(len(inp))
94626
print(inp[:20])

# Search Through a file
- We can put an if statement in our for loop to only print lines that meet some criteria
