# Programming

## Algorithms
- A set of rules or steps used to solve a problem

## Data Structures
- A particular way of organizing data in a computer

## What is not a "Collection"
Most of our variables have one value in them - when we put a new value in the variable, the old value is overwritten

```
x = 2
x = 4
print(x)
```

## A List is a kind of collection
- A collection allows us to put many values in a single "variable"
- A collection is nice because we can carry many values around in one convenient package

```
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
carryon = ['socks', 'shirt', 'perfume']
```

### List Constants
- List constants are surrounded by square brackets and the elements in the list are separated by commas
- A list element can be any Python object - even another list
- A list can be empty

```
print([1, 24, 76])
print(['red', 'yellow', 'blue'])
print(['red', 24, 98.6])
print([1, [5, 6], 7])
print([])
```

### Lists and Definite Loops 

```
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for friend in friends:
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)
print("Done!")
```

### Looking Inside Lists
Just like strings, we can get at any single element in a list using an index specified in square brackets

```
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
print(friends[1])
```

### Lists are mutable
- Strings are "immutable" - we cannot change the contents of a string - we must make a new string to make any change
- Lists are "mutable" - we can change an element of a list using the index operator

```
fruit = 'Banana'
#fruit[0] = 'b' #This will give you an error

x = fruit.lower() #makes a copy of the string because strings are immutable
print(x)
lotto = [2, 14, 26, 41, 63]
print(lotto)
lotto[2] = 28 #changes the value in idx 2 of the list to 28
print(lotto)
```

### How long is a list?
- The len() function takes a list as a parameter and returns the number of elements in the list
- Actually len() tells us the number of elements of any set or sequence (such as a string...)

```
greet = 'Hello Bob'
print(len(greet))

x = [1, 2, 'joe', 99]
print(len(x))
```

## Using the Range function
- The range function returns a list of numbers that range from zero to one less than the parameter
- We can construct an index loop using for and an integer iterator

```
print(range(4))
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
print(len(friends))
print(list(range(len(friends))))
```

## A Tale of two loops
```
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
for friend in friends:
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)

for in range(len(friends)):
    friend = friends[i]
    print('Happy New Year:', friend)

friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
print(len(friends))

print(list(range(len(friends))))
```
