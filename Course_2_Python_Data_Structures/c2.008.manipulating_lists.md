# List manipulation

## Concatenating Lists Using +
- We can create a new list by adding two existing lists together

```
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = a + b
print(c)

print(a)
```

## Lists Can Be Sliced Using:
```
t = [9, 41, 12, 3, 74, 15]
t[1:3]
t[:4]
t[3:]
t[:]
```
Remember: Just like in strings, the second number is "up to but not including"

## List Methods
```
x = list()
type(x)
dir(x)
```

## Building a List from Scratch
- We can create an empty list and then add elements using the append method
- The list stays in order and new elements are added at the end of the list
```
stuff = list()
stuff.append('book')
stuff.append(99)
print(stuff)
stuff.append('cookie')
print(stuff)
```

## Is something in a list?
- Python provides two operators that let you check if an item is in a list
- These are logical operators that return True or false
- They do not modify the list
```
some = [1, 9, 21, 10, 16]
9 in some
15 in some
20 not in some
```

## Lists are in order
- A list can hold many items and keeps those items in the order until we do something to change the order
- A list can be sorted (i.e., chanhe its order)
- The sort method (unlike in strings) means "sort yourself"
```
friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
friends.sort()
print(friends)
print(friends[1])
```

## Built in functions and lists
- There are a number of functions built into Python that take lists as parameters
- Remember the loops we built? These are much simpler
```
nums = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]
print(len(nums))
print(max(nums))
print(min(nums))
print(sum(nums))
print(sum(nums) / len(nums))
```

```
total = 0
count = 0
while True:
    inp = input("Enter a number: ")
    if inp == 'done' : break
    value = float(inp)
    total = total + value
    count = count + 1
average = total / count
print('Average:', average)
```

```
numlist = list()
while True:
    inp = input("Enter a number: ")
    if inp == 'done' : break
    value = float(inp)
    numlist.append(value)
average = sum(numlist) / len(numlist)
print('Average:', average)
```
