# Service Oriented Approach

- Most non-trivial web applications use services
- They use services from other applications
    - Credit Card Charge
    - Hotel Reservation Systems
- Services publish the "rules" applications must follow to make use of the service (API)
- Application Program Interfaces (API) - ways to use web protocols to access data on systems, using well-defined and structured approaches

## Multiple Systems

- Initially - 2 systems cooperate and split the problem
- As the data/service becomes useful - multiple applications want to use the information/application
