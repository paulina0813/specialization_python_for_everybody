# Data on the Web
- With the HTTP Request/Reponse well understood and well supported, there was a natural move toward exchanging data between programs using these protocols
- We needed to come up with an agreed way to represent data going between applications and across networks
- There are two commonly used formats: XML and JSON
- The data must be serialized and then deserialized
- The data is serialized into a "wire language"
